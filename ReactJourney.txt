React Journey

- Props are nothing but the data passed to the component to use inside it.

- Proptypes are used to validate if the data passed is of a fixed datatype, i.e. you can't pass a string, if you've specified your prop as a number; Like typescript
i.e. (inside the component file)
[ComponentName].propTypes = {
    title: PropTypes.string,
    about: PropTypes.number.isRequired // In order to compulsory pass it, we can use .isRequired
}

- Default Props - Default values, if props aren't passed.
i.e. (inside the component file)
[ComponentName].defaultProps = {
    title: "Default title",
    about: "Default About Text"
}

- STATE 
Used to change something or execute something over some data entered by the user
It is used by importing {useState} from 'react'
i.e.
// Setting a default value
const [data, changeData] = useState("My default data"); // This means that 'data' variable will be used to represent the data, and the 'changeData' will be used to change the data inside 'data'
